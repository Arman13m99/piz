## 🎨 Customization

### Change Ranking Colors
Edit `config.py`:
```python
RANK_COLORS = {
    "Total Orders": "#6A0DAD",        # Purple
    "Organic Orders": "#228B22",      # Green
    "Non-Organic Orders": "#FF8C00",  # Orange
    "Organic/Non-Organic Ratio": "#808080",  # Gray
    "Avg Daily Orders": "#4682B4"     # Blue
}
```

### Add New Ranking Criteria
```python
RANKING_CRITERIA = {
    "Total Orders": "total_order_count",
    "Your New Metric": "your_column_name",  # Add this line
}
```

### Adjust Performance Settings
```python
# For large datasets
MAX_VENDORS_FOR_OVERLAP = 200  # Reduce for faster performance
AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL = 60000   # Refresh every minute instead of 30 seconds
```

## 🌐 Network Setup

### For Internal Team Use:
1. **Start the application**: `python run.py`
2. **Note the Network URL**: Usually `http://192.168.x.x:5000`
3. **Share with team**: Send the URL via email/chat
4. **Firewall**: May need to allow Python through Windows Firewall

### For External Access:
```bash
# Install security extensions
pip install Flask-Talisman Flask-Limiter

# Configure router port forwarding (advanced users)
# Forward external port 8080 to internal port 5000
```

### Multiple Simultaneous Users:
- ✅ **Fully supported** - Multiple people can use simultaneously
- ✅ **Real-time sync** - Changes from one user appear for all users
- ✅ **Independent sessions** - Each user can have different theme preferences
- ✅ **Shared filtering** - When someone hides vendors, everyone sees the update

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Port already in use"
```bash
# The startup script automatically finds an available port
python run.py  # Will use 5001, 5002, etc. if 5000 is busy
```

### "Can't access from other devices"
1. **Check firewall**: Allow Python through firewall
2. **Verify network**: Make sure devices are on same WiFi
3. **Try different port**: Edit `config.py` and change `PORT = 8080`

### "Map doesn't load / No vendors showing"
1. **Check data files**: Ensure files are in `data/` directory
2. **Verify coordinates**: Make sure lat/lon are within Tehran bounds
3. **Check console**: Press F12 in browser and look for error messages

### "Real-time updates not working"
1. **Refresh browser**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5
2. **Check JavaScript**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled
3. **Network connectivity**: Verify stable network connection

### Performance Issues
```python
# In config.py, adjust these settings:
MAX_VENDORS_FOR_OVERLAP = 100       # Reduce for faster overlap calculation
ENABLE_REAL_TIME_FILTERING = True   # Keep True for live features
AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL = 60000       # Increase for less frequent updates
```
